Progressive Authentication for Linux
====================================

The PAL system sets up a progressive authentication scheme for Linux
systems.  Upon login, users are given a fresh, anonymous user with no
privileges, and users can request additional privileges to be given to
them, by requesting additional groups to be added to their shell.  A
centralized authentication daemon handles these authentication
requests.
