Current plan for implementation:

 + A userspace setuid binary or root daemon allows a user to spawn a
      shell with added or dropped permissions, after doing the
      necessary authentication.

 + User logins (through SSH) go to an anonymous user with effectively
      no permissions.  Some setuid binary or root daemon cleans these
      directories when you log out.

 + Some scripts need to add groups with certain privileges.  This may
      need to conform to distro-specific conventions for GID
      allocation.

 + How do applications request certain capabilities?  We might want
      some sort of manifest file for applications that specifies what
      capabilities they might want and should be granted.
